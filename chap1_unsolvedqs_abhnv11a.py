Unsolved Questions:
1. Computational thinking refers to the ability to approach problems and tasks in a way that a computer or machine would. 


2. Decomposition: breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts.

Pattern recognition: identifying patterns, similarities, and differences among problems.

Abstraction: focusing on the essential details and ignoring irrelevant information.

Algorithm design: creating a set of instructions to solve a problem or complete a task.

By applying computational thinking skills, software developers can break down complex problems, identify patterns, and develop logical and efficient solutions that can be interpreted into software applications.


3. Free: Python is free to use, distribute, and modify. This means that anyone can download and use Python without paying for it.
Open source: Python is an open-source programming language, which means that its source code is freely available to anyone who wants to view or modify it.

4. Performance: Python may not be the best choice for applications that require very high performance.
Python may not be the best choice for developing applications for mobile and embedded devices.
Security: Python's dynamic code execution can make it vulnerable to security threats.
Python has limitations with database access.

5. In interactive mode, the user enters commands directly into the Python interpreter and receives immediate feedback. In script mode, the Python code is written in a text file and saved with the ".py" extension, and then executed by running the file using the Python interpreter.

6. An example of Computational Thinking is breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable parts and developing a step-by-step solution to solve the problem.

7. Computational Thinking can be used for problem-solving by following a structured approach to break down a problem into smaller parts, analyzing data and information, and developing a step-by-step solution.

8. A flowchart is a diagrammatic representation of a process or algorithm, while an algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or achieving a specific outcome.

16. Computational thinking involves using problem-solving skills and techniques to solve complex problems. It involves breaking down a problem into smaller parts, identifying patterns, and designing algorithms to solve them. Algorithmic thinking, on the other hand, is the process of designing and analyzing algorithms to solve a particular problem.

17. The components of computational thinking are decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, algorithms, and evaluation.

18. Pattern matching is the process of identifying patterns in data or information. It is a fundamental concept in computational thinking and is used in a variety of applications, including image recognition, natural language processing, and data mining.

19. Decomposition involves breaking down a problem into smaller, more manageable parts. By breaking a problem into smaller pieces, it becomes easier to understand and solve. This leads to simplicity because each small piece can be solved independently, and the solution can then be combined to solve the larger problem.

20. Planning is an essential component of computational thinking because it helps to organize and structure the problem-solving process. It involves identifying the steps needed to solve a problem, creating a plan of action, and executing the plan. Planning helps to ensure that the problem is approached systematically and that all necessary steps are taken to reach a solution.

GST = total_cost * 0.05
bill = total_cost + GST

Print "Item: ", item_name

25. Python was developed by Guido van Rossum. Python was influenced by two programming languages: ABC and Modula-3.

26. Yes

27. IDLE is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Python. It provides a graphical user interface for writing and running Python code.

28. In Python, displaying refers to showing the output on the screen or in the console, while printing refers to writing the output to a file or a stream. The print function is used for printing output to the console.

29. Some salient features of Python are:

It is an interpreted language, meaning that the code is executed line by line.
It has a simple and easy-to-learn syntax.
It is a dynamically-typed language, meaning that the data type of a variable is determined at runtime.
It supports multiple programming paradigms, such as procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
It has a large standard library, which provides many useful modules and functions.
It is open-source and cross-platform.

30. Cross-platform software refers to software that can run on multiple operating systems without modification. Python is a cross-platform language, which means that Python code can run on different platforms such as Windows, Mac, and Linux.

31. Some advantages of Python programming language are:

It has a simple and easy-to-learn syntax.
It is a dynamically-typed language, which makes it more flexible than statically-typed languages.
It has a large standard library, which provides many useful modules and functions.
Object oriented programming language.
It is platform independent. 
Supports many GUI applications.

32. These include,the Python interpreter, using a text editor or IDE, or running Python script mode.

33. Advantages of working in Interactive mode in Python are that it allows for quick testing and experimentation of code. However, the disadvantages are that it can be harder to keep track of the code, and it can be harder to reuse or modify the code later.
